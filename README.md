# rails_refactoring_sample
some simple demo of rails refactoring tips

* There are 2 files within each sample_patterns/lib/*
  - before.rb represents the code with code smell
  - after.rb represents the code after refactoring

* A `Rakefile` with a test task.
  - To run the tests against the code sample _before_ refactoring, run
    `$BEFORE=whatever rake test`;
  - To run the tests against the code sample _before_ refactoring, run `$rake
    test`;
